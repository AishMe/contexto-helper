## 🎮 What is Contexto?

Contexto is a daily word game where you try to guess a secret word. Every guess is ranked by how semantically similar it is to the answer — **#1 means you found it**. The challenge is figuring out which direction to search based on your rankings.

Contexto Helper analyses your guesses and uses AI to suggest the most likely next words to try.

## ✨ Features

- **Guess Tracker** — log every word you've tried with its rank
- **Colour-coded ranking** — 🟢 green (top 100), 🟡 yellow (101–500), 🔴 red (500+)
- **AI Suggestions** — analyses your guess patterns and recommends 5 words to try next
- **Strategy Tips** — explains the semantic theme the AI detects in your guesses
- **Bring Your Own Key** — optionally use your own OpenAI or Anthropic API key for better suggestions
- **Persistent guesses** — your session is saved across page refreshes
- **Free to use** — powered by free AI models via OpenRouter

## 🚀 Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18+
- A free [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AishMe/contexto-helper.git
cd contexto-helper
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
```

Get a free key (no credit card needed) at → [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npx vercel dev
```

> **Why `vercel dev` instead of `npm run dev`?**
> The AI suggestion feature runs via a Vercel serverless function (`/api/suggest.js`).
> `vercel dev` emulates this locally. Plain `npm run dev` will only serve the UI.

App runs at → **`http://localhost:3000`**

2. Click **Add New Project** and select your forked repo
3. Framework preset: **Vite** (auto-detected)
4. Click **Deploy**

### 3. Add your API key

## 🔑 Using Your Own AI Key (BYOK)

For better suggestions, use your own API key from a premium provider via the in-app Settings panel:

- **OpenAI** — gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini
- **Anthropic** — claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-6
- **OpenRouter paid models** — any model on OpenRouter

Click the ⚙️ **Settings** icon in the app, paste your key, and choose your provider. Your key is stored only in your browser's localStorage and is never sent to our servers.
